# Support

Please take advantage of the many i.MX7 96 resources available to you through 96Boards, Arrow, and more...

- [96Boards i.MX7 96 Forum](https://discuss.96boards.org/c/products/imx7-96)
   - The DragonBoard has its very own 96Boards forum. If you can't find a pre-existing thread that addresses your issue, start your own and let the community help out!
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things)
   - i.MX7 96 uses the same specification! Students from the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) put together an "Internet of Things" (IoT) course focused around the DragonBoard 410c (again, same specification as i.MX7 96!). It is free to audit, or you can purchase the specialization package for a cool certificate!
- [Report a bug!](/documentation/Extras/Report_a_bug.md.html)
   - Instructions on how to report bugs for any of our 96Boards hardware and software, this includes the i.MX7 96!
